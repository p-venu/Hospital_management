      The <strong>Hospital_Management</strong> project is currently under development and is in the process of being sold.  
      To ensure confidentiality, <strong>code copying is strictly prohibited.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-5 leading-relaxed">
      During development, please focus mainly on the <strong>Cardiology Department</strong> and the  
      <strong>Head of the Cardiology Department</strong> section.  
      Each <strong>doctorâ€™s profile photo</strong> acts as a clickable link to their detailed profile.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-5 leading-relaxed">
      Most of the backend code has been intentionally removed to comply with the  
      <strong>GitHub Pages static site policy</strong>, allowing only static content to be hosted.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-5 leading-relaxed">
      The <strong>Care Connect Bot</strong> is the official assistant for this project.  
      Ask the bot for <strong>Cardiology Tips</strong> â€” it will show you helpful links and guide you to the related pages.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-5 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Patient details</strong> are shared safely with their registered phone numbers in  
      <strong>PDF format</strong> and can also be accessed online.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-5 leading-relaxed">
      Since this is a static website, <strong>server-based authentication</strong> has been replaced with  
      a simple <strong>integrated static password system, and particularly designed for desktop, try to view in desktop</strong>
